What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting information from websites by using computer
programs or scripts. This technique involves sending a request to a website, retrieving the HTML
code of the requested page, parsing the HTML to understand its structure, and then extracting
relevant data. Web scraping is commonly done using programming languages like Python and
libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. It serves various purposes, including data extraction,
price comparison, news aggregation, and website monitoring. It's important to be aware of the
legal and ethical implications of web scraping, as it can potentially violate a website's terms of
service if performed without permission. Therefore, it's crucial to review and adhere to the terms
and conditions of a website before engaging in any scraping activities.

Different Types of Web Scrapers?
Web scrapers come in various types, and their design depends on the specific requirements of the
scraping task. Here are some common types of web scrapers:

1. Basic HTML Scrapers:
- These scrapers extract data directly from HTML code.
- They are suitable for simple scraping tasks where the data is readily available in the page
source.

2. DOM Scrapers:

- These scrapers leverage the Document Object Model (DOM) to navigate and
extract data from the structured representation of the HTML page.

3. API Scrapers:

- Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow
developers to access data in a structured format.
- API scrapers interact with these APIs to extract data, which is often a more reliable
and efficient method compared to traditional scraping.

4. Browser Automation Scrapers:

- These scrapers use browser automation tools like Selenium to simulate human
interaction with a website.
- They can handle complex tasks that involve interacting with dynamic content and
performing actions like clicking buttons or filling forms.

Different Web Scraping tools

1. Octoparse:
- Octoparse is a user-friendly visual scraping tool that allows users to point-and-click
to extract data from websites. It supports both static and dynamic websites and provides
features for data cleaning and transformation.

2. Beautiful Soup:
- Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It
provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, making it
a popular choice for web scraping tasks.

3. Scrapy:
- Scrapy is an open-source web crawling framework for Python. It is designed to
handle large-scale web scraping projects and provides tools for extracting data, processing
it, and storing it in various formats.

Step 1: Pasting URL of Formula 1 Official Twitter Account

Step 2: Select the tweets to analyze and what part of the tweet to analyze

Step 3: The Data from the selected fields and the tweet will be shown below, we can add and
remove the data from the bar.

Step 4: Create a Workflow so that the Octoparse can parse and collect multiple tweets in a
single go

Step 4: Execute the Workflow using Run command and data will be shown. We can export the
data using the Export button. Data can be exported In Excel , CSV and even in SQL format.

Step 5: The data will be processed and the data will be stored on the local machine in the
required format
