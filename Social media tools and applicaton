YouTube platform, but also has analytical information regarding Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
TikTok, Trovo, Dailymotion, Mixer, DLive, and StoryFire.

Twitter Analytics / X Analytics:
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a specific tool called "X/Twitter Analytics."
However, Twitter provides its own analytics platform called Twitter Analytics. This tool allows users,
particularly businesses and content creators, to track the performance of their tweets and overall
account. It offers insights into tweet engagement, audience demographics, and trends over time. Users
can analyze impressions, clicks, likes, retweets, and other engagement metrics to understand the impact
of their content on the platform. Keep in mind that platforms and features can evolve, so it's
recommended to check the latest information for the most accurate details.
