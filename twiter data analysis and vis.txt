Twitter Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Python.
NLTK is a comprehensive library for NLP and text processing. It includes tools and resources for
tasks like tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.
1. Handling NaN Values:
Checks if the tweet text is missing (NaN). If it is, the function returns an empty string to avoid
errors during processing.
2. Lowercasing:
Converts all text to lowercase. This ensures consistency in text processing, as uppercase and
lowercase versions of the same word would otherwise be treated differently.

3. Removing URLs:
Deletes any URLs present in the tweet text. URLs don't typically contribute to the meaning of
the text and can be safely removed.
4. Removing Usernames and Hashtags:
Eliminates usernames (e.g., @username) and hashtags (e.g., #topic) from the text. These
elements are specific to social media platforms like Twitter and are often not relevant for
analysis.
5. Removing Special Characters:
Deletes any special characters (e.g., punctuation marks, symbols) from the text. Special
characters may interfere with text analysis algorithms and are usually unnecessary for
understanding the text's content.
6. Removing "RT" (Retweet) Tag:
Eliminates the "RT" tag often found at the beginning of retweets. This tag indicates that the
tweet is a retweet and is usually not relevant for analysis.
7. Removing Mentions, URLs, and Special Characters:
Removes any mentions of other users, URLs, and additional special characters. This ensures
that only the main text content remains, without any metadata or extraneous information.
8. Removing Single Characters:
Deletes single characters surrounded by whitespace. These single characters are typically not
meaningful on their own and are removed to improve text readability.
9. Removing Multiple Spaces:
Reduces multiple consecutive whitespace characters to a single space. This ensures that the text
is formatted correctly and doesn't contain unnecessary whitespace.
10. Stripping Leading and Trailing Whitespace:
Removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the text. This step ensures that the text is clean
and doesn't contain any extra space characters at the beginning or end.

Twitter Data Visualization using word cloud.
A word cloud is a visual representation of text data, where the size of each word indicates its
frequency or importance within the text. In a word cloud, more frequently occurring words are
typically displayed in larger font sizes, making them visually prominent, while less frequent words
appear smaller.
